# Homebrew-neural-network
A homebrew neural network done in python using numpy but no neural network specific tools. For more information about the network have a look at Neural_network_project_review.ipynb. If you decide to go through this please bear in mind that I absolutely LOATH writing and I got very sick of the write up whilst I was going through the maths for back propagation so take everything there with a massive pinch of salt since I started just copying out my 3am notes without any critical thinking about them. The conclusions and references I did first though so those should be ok.
